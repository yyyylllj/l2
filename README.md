Untitled is the code to train a network with L_2,∞normlzation on trainingset Clfar10.\\
Untitled0 is the code to train a network with L_2,∞normlzation on trainingset MNIST.\\
you can change four parameters.\\
BC:the stepsize of trainset,always 64 or 32\\
XLBC:the stepsize of training\\
Ln:the upperbound of L_2,∞normlization,you can find in paper\\
LS:hou many turns you want to train\\
recommend:\\
Consider of the instability of algorithm, try small XLBC and increase LS.\\
